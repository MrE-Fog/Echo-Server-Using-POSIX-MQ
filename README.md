# Echo-Server-Using-POSIX-MQ
This is a simple and compact simulation of an echo Server using POXIS message queue.

#How it works
The prent process will be the sever and child will be the client in this case. Child will query user for input, then send it to parent, then parent
will respond with expected output to child, finall child will print it out to user.
